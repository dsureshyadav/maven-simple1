                        JENKINS
====================================
STEP 1: INSTALL JAVA8 ON CENTOS FROM GOOGLE SEARCH  from it
cmds are 1) cd /opt/
        2)wget --no-cookies --no-check-certificate --header "Cookie: gpw_e24=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oracle.com%2F; oraclelicense=accept-securebackup-cookie" "http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/java/jdk/8u161-b12/2f38c3b165be4555a1fa6e98c45e0808/jdk-8u161-linux-x64.tar.gz"
        3)tar xzf jdk-8u161-linux-x64.tar.gz
4)cd /opt/jdk1.8.0_161/
5)alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /opt/jdk1.8.0_161/bin/java 2
6)alternatives --config java

7) + 2           /opt/jdk1.8.0_45/bin/java
               enter 2
then only

java installed in your meachine check version java --version

STEP 2: yum updates -y then yum needto install jenkins from jenkins.io ->downloads-centos->run these cmds 
1)sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
2)sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key


 yum install jenkins
jenkins is installed in your meachine

3)service jenkins start
4)service jenkins status 

 STEP 3:
======== COPY THE IP ADDRESS OF AWS MEACHINE AND PASTE IN BROWSER PORT NO :8080 AND ENTER IT
YOU WILL GET UNLOCKS JENKINS OPEN IT THERE CMD IS cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminpwd copy it and paste in jenkins unlock 
automatically you will go to jenkins server
 and set up your own user name and pwd will create.


               JENKINS JOB OR PROJECT
=============================================
STEP 1: NEW ITEM =ANY NAME
   free syle project -select
and will comes general   sourcecodemgmt   build triggers  build environment  build  post-build actions
                :
                the project is parameteraise in that add parameters (choice paramete credintial param etc )
save & apply
project is ready

STEP 2: SELECT -BUILD NOW build is success
STEP 3: GO TO CONSOLE OUTPUT
    SEE THE PATH 
WHERE WE ARE IN WORKSPACE AND CHECK IN JENKINS SERVER 
CD /WORKSPACE/JOB 0R PROJECTNAME

SUCCESS

AND SAME AS GIT
============
  STEP1 :GIT HUB ACCOUNT GLONE COPY AND PASTE IN JENKINS CONSOLE 
SELECT CONFIGURE-> ADD GIT HUB REPOSITORY AND 
CLICK ON BUILD NOW
STEP 2:CHECK IN JENKINS SERVER
 IF IT WILL THE FILES ARE COME SUCCESS IT OTHERWISE YOU NEED TO INSTALL GIT

STEP 3: I WANT TO CREATE USER GO TO MANAGE JENKIS ->MANAGE USERS AND CREATE USER
 THEN WHO WANT TO ACCESS THIS GO TO MANAGEJENKINS ->CONFIGURE GLOBAL SECURITY->INTHAT BYDEFAULT SELECT JENKIS USER DATABASE UNDER THIS SELECT ALLOW USERS TO SIGNUP IT IS 
UNDER TAB ACCESS CONTROL

NEXT AUTHORISATION
===============
SELECT MATRIX BASEDSECURITY-> YOU CAN ADD YOUR USER/GROUP NAME TO ACCESS THIS AUTHENTICATION

HERE AUTHENTICATION AND ACCESS CONTROL IS DONE



                                   HOW TO BUILD MAVEN IN JENKINS STEPS
============================================================================
STEP 1: INSTALL MAVEN PLUGINS IN CONSOLE FOR THIS GO TO MANAGE JENKINS ->MANAGE PLUGIN -> AVAILABLE TAB -> SEARCH MAVEN INTEGRATION IN THAT YOU SELECT INSTALL WITHOUT RESTART
MAVEN INSTALLED SUCCESSFULLY IN GUI CONSOLE

STEP 2: AND SAME AS IN JENKINS SERVER MEANS CMD CONTROLL
 FOR THIS GO TO MAVEN CENTOS IN GOOGLE SEARCH AND  INTHAT FROM STEP2 TO STEP 4: YOU CAN EXECUTE ALL THOSE CMDS AFTER CHECK MVN -VERSION IF IT WILL SHOW IT IS SUCCESS
OTHERWISE NO.

 
  I NEED TO CONFIGURE JAVA PATH AND MAVEN PATH IN JENKINS GUI CONSOLE
==============================================================================
FOR THIS 
STEP 1: GO TO MANAGE JENKINS =>GLOBAL TOOL CONFIGURATION ADD JDK -> JAVA NAME - ANY NAME
                                                                    JAVA HOME- JAVA PATH WHAT YOU INSTALLED  IN JENKINS SERVER
                                                                    MAVAN NAME - ANY NAME
                                                                    MAVAN HOME -MAVAN PATH
GOTO "HELLO WORLD WAR GIT FILE" TO SEARCH IN GOOGLE AND COPY THE CLONE IT AND PASTE IN JENKINS GUI CONSOLE IN GIT REPOSITORY AND 

SELECT BUILD PERIODICALLY IN LINUX (CRON JOB CMD EXECUTES) FOR EVERY MIN(15) EVERY HOUR(*) EVERY MONTH(*) EVERY DAY(*) YOU TYPE IN BUILD PERIODICALLY THEN 
APPLY AND SAVE IT 
TO SEE THE PATH IN JENKINS SERVER

THAT CRON JOB IS DONE.

SAME AS MAVEN PROJECT BY THROUGH WEBHOOKS VIA TOMCAT
=======================================================
FOR THIS TOMCAT YOU HAVE TO DO FIRST
 STEP1: TOMCAT INSTALLATION BY GIVING RAMIREDDY DOCUMENTATION FOLLOW THOSE STEPS AS IT AS.

STEP 2:CD BIN FOLDER ./START.SH   --CHMOD 777 ./START.SH FOR PERMISSION AND ./SHUTDOWN.SH SAME AS CHMOD 777 ./SHTDOWN.SH
CHMOD 777 ./CATALINA.HOME 
FINALLY ./START.SH START
GO TO BROWSER give the ipaddress:8081
tomcat started then go to manage app->here give the credintial and uname :admin  pwd: admin


TAKE ONE EXAMPLE OF HELLOWORLD MAVEN SIMPLE IN GOOGLE AND 

YOU CAN IMPORT FROM YOUR GIT HUB ACCOUNT AND THEN 
POM.XML MODIFIED AND COMMITTED IT 
THEN GO TO COPY THE ADDRESS GIVE IN JENKINS GIT AND SELECT ON GITHUB HOOK SCM POLLING THEN SAVE IT

FINALLY IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY BUILD AND DEPLOY TO THE CONSOLE OUTPUT BY THROUGH WEBHOOKS.

COMPLETED.


JENKINS WITH JROG ARTIFACTORY
===============================
Take one new instance

GOTO OFFICIAL SITE JFROG.COM/OPENSOURCE-->download zip file and get it by winscp to your linux system and unzip it

cd bin
ls
run the cmd sh artifactoryctl start
tomcat stated
go to the browser http://given ipaddress:8081(default port no)

it will open and setup admin credentials uname :admin
                                         pwd:password1
goto localrepository->select on maven project and give the name

now go to jenkins server -> manage plugins ->available->search artifactory ->install it.- > and come to project ->configure ->postbuld actions->deploy to artifactory

finnow jenkins home->manageplugins ->configure system-> find add arifactory servers-> server id ->any name 
                                                                                      URL ->//artifactory ip address :8081
                                                                                       UNAME : admin	
                                                                                      password:password1

delivery to maven artifactory : include :**/*.war
build it
automatically it will updated here.

completed jfrog
=====================

jenkins with cli and u want operate also from jenkins api 
==========================================================

FOR TEST QUALITY PURPOSE YOU WILL USE SONAR CUBE (SIR GIVEN URL FROM THERE GET IT AND PRACTICE IT)
====================================================================================================

DELIVERY PIPELINE
=================================

STEP 3
